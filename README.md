# Laptop Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, and screen size. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can estimate the price of a laptop given these attributes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for code execution and visualization)

## Project Overview
This project uses a dataset containing various laptop specifications and their corresponding prices. We clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and then build different machine learning models to predict the price of a laptop. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ².

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Brand**: Brand name of the laptop
- **Processor**: Type of processor (Intel, AMD, etc.)
- **RAM**: Size of RAM (in GB)
- **Storage**: Type and size of storage (HDD, SSD, in GB)
- **Display Size**: Size of the screen (in inches)
- **Operating System**: OS type (Windows, MacOS, etc.)
- **Price**: Target variable, the price of the laptop in USD



## Steps to Run the Project
